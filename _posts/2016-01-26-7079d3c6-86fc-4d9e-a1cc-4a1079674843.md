Welcome to The Grid.

I decided to try the next generation in web design. So, I guess I have a blog(?) now. This is my first site on The Grid and I'm working to understand how it works. I intend to use this site to post about my professional endeavors in life. I currently work heavily with python and bash used for automation of system administration.
